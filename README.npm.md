## Introduction

Almost every application nowadays, requires a database to persist data. We have integrated [`ObjectionJS`](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) as our supported ORM.

`ObjectionJS` provides very clean and fluent APIs to build and run complex queries at ease. We have worked in the past with many ORMs, but `ObjectionJS` stood out, it is relatively young but more mature in terms of its offerings.

**Why we ‚ù§Ô∏è ObjectionJS**:

- ‚úÖ Very clean and mature Query Builder
- ‚úÖ Fluent Relational Queries
- ‚úÖ Official Typescript Support
- ‚úÖ Clean Migrations and Seeders using [`KnexJS`](http://knexjs.org/)
- ‚úÖ Support for Hooks
- ‚úÖ Powerful model entity relation operations
- ‚úÖ Easy to use Transactions
